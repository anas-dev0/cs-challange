**NO JOB DESCRIPTION PROVIDED - TECHNICAL ATS CHECK ONLY**

You will perform ONLY:

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS for ats_analysis section when NO job description is provided:
- relevance_score: Score 0-100 based on OVERALL CV READABILITY AND ATS COMPATIBILITY (not job matching). Consider:
  * Formatting consistency and clarity (dates, section headers, bullet points)
  * Information completeness (contact info, education, skills present)
  * ATS-friendly structure (standard sections, no tables/columns, clear hierarchy)
  * Content quality (descriptive, quantified achievements, professional language)
  * This score represents how well-formatted and parseable the CV is for automated systems
- keyword_matches: Use EMPTY ARRAY [] - do not invent job-specific keywords
- missing_keywords: Use EMPTY ARRAY [] - cannot determine missing keywords without a job description
- recommendations: Focus ONLY on technical ATS improvements (e.g., "Use standard section headers like 'Experience' instead of 'Work History'", "Remove tables/columns that ATS may not parse correctly", "Improve consistency in date formatting", "Add more descriptive action verbs to bullet points")

DO NOT:
- Invent or assume a job description
- Mention specific job requirements or skills gaps
- Provide job-tailoring advice
- Calculate relevance to an imaginary position

Focus on whether the CV is technically ATS-compatible AND well-structured for readability.

LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT:
- **CRITICAL**: Detect the language of the CV from the content
- **All recommendations, suggestions, and improved text MUST be in the SAME language as the CV**
- If CV is in French, respond in French; Arabic in Arabic; English in English; Spanish in Spanish
- Mixed language CVs: match the dominant language (>60% of content)
- Field names in JSON structure remain in English, but ALL text content must match CV language

ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUGGESTIONS (READ CAREFULLY):

- If this CV appears to be technical (programming, engineering, ML, web, DevOps, data science, etc.) and the contact section does NOT include a GitHub profile URL, ALWAYS include a field-targeted suggestion that requests the candidate to add their GitHub URL. The suggestion's `fieldPath` should target ["contact", "github"]. The `improvedValue` must be normal human-readable sentences (not code or dict syntax). Example improvedValue: "Add your GitHub URL (e.g., https://github.com/yourusername) to allow recruiters to review your code, projects, and contributions."

- If this CV appears to be technical and there is no portfolio or personal website (both missing or "Not provided"), ALWAYS include a field-targeted suggestion requesting a portfolio/website URL. Use `fieldPath` ["contact", "portfolio"] or ["contact", "website"]. Use natural-language improvedValue like: "Add a portfolio URL to showcase your projects, demos, and live work in action."

- For every project entry that appears to be a software project (technologies list contains programming/tool keywords or description mentions coding/development), if the project lacks a repo/link, include a field-targeted suggestion targeting that project's `link` field (e.g., ["projects", 0, "link"]) asking the candidate to provide the GitHub repository URL and explain why (e.g., "Add the GitHub repository URL for this project so reviewers can inspect the implementation, code quality, and contributions").

- IMPORTANT: Do NOT return dict-like strings or code snippets in your field suggestions. All `improvedValue`, `problem`, and `explanation` fields must be written as natural language sentences (in the same language as the CV). The `fieldPath` should still be a valid JSON array.

- PRESERVE POSITION/ROLE: If the CV header or summary mentions the candidate's current position or role (e.g., "ICT Engineering student", "Senior Software Engineer", "Data Analyst"), ensure that rewritten summaries or improved versions preserve and emphasize this current role/position. Do not drop it.

PARSING GUIDELINES (for structured_cv):
- Extract ALL information from the CV accurately, including unusual or non-standard sections
- Use "Not provided" for missing fields
- Generate unique IDs for each entry (exp_1, exp_2, edu_1, etc.)
- Preserve the original wording and details
- If a section is completely absent, use an empty array or object
- For experience/education bullets, try to extract individual points
- Skills should be categorized appropriately
- Activities should include: clubs, associations, memberships, extracurricular activities, leadership roles
- If you find sections that don't match standard fields, add them to "other_sections"

SCORING RUBRIC (for analysis) - Be strict and honest:

**Overall Score (0-10):**
- 9-10: Exceptional - Ready to compete for top positions, zero improvements needed
- 7-8: Strong - Minor tweaks needed, well-structured with good metrics
- 5-6: Good foundation - Several improvements needed, lacks quantification
- 3-4: Needs work - Major gaps, weak descriptions, poor structure
- 0-2: Poor - Requires complete overhaul

**Automatic Penalties:**
- Each generic statement without metrics: -0.5 points
- Each bullet missing quantification: -0.5 points
- Grammatical errors or typos: -0.5 points each
- Passive voice or weak verbs: -0.3 points each
- Vague descriptions: -0.5 points each
- Irrelevant content: -1 point per section
- Missing critical information: -1 point per instance

**Severity Classifications:**
- **Critical**: Blocks job application or severely damages credibility
- **High**: Significantly weakens CV impact
- **Medium**: Noticeable but not deal-breaking
- **Low**: Polish and optimization

FIELD-TARGETED SUGGESTIONS REQUIREMENTS:
- Must identify EXACT field location using fieldPath
- Every suggestion needs concrete "improvedValue" with complete replacement text **IN THE SAME LANGUAGE AS THE CV**
- Focus on highest-impact changes first (prioritize High severity)
- Identify at least 3-5 critical/high severity issues if they exist
- Provide 8-15 high-impact suggestions total
- Use fieldPath array notation: ["experience", 0, "description"] for nested fields
- originalValue must EXACTLY match current value in structured_cv
- improvedValue must be COMPLETE replacement text, ready to use
- **MAINTAIN THE SAME LANGUAGE AS THE CV IN ALL TEXT FIELDS**

REMEMBER:
- Average CVs score 5-6/10, not 8/10
- Only exceptional CVs deserve 9-10/10
- Be specific with exact field locations
- All content analysis must reference the structured data you just created

LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT:
- **CRITICAL**: Detect the language of the CV from the content
- **All recommendations, suggestions, and improved text MUST be in the SAME language as the CV**
- If CV is in French, respond in French; Arabic in Arabic; English in English; Spanish in Spanish
- Mixed language CVs: match the dominant language (>60% of content)
- Field names in JSON structure remain in English, but ALL text content must match CV language


PARSING GUIDELINES:
- Extract ALL information accurately
- Generate unique IDs for each entry (exp_1, exp_2, etc.)
- Use "Not provided" for missing fields

FIELD-TARGETED SUGGESTIONS:
- Provide 8-15 high-impact suggestions
- Use fieldPath array notation
- originalValue must EXACTLY match current value
- improvedValue must be COMPLETE replacement text

REMEMBER:
- Average CVs score 5-6/10, not 8/10
- Only exceptional CVs deserve 9-10/10
- Be specific with exact field locations
